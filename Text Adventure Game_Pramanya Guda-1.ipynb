    "Welcome to the text adventure game of Sherlock Holmes: Pursuit of the Python.\n",
    "This game immerses players in the intriguing world of mystery-solving and the science of deduction. The player is the niece/nephew of Dr. John Watson; Sherlock's partner in crime. The narrative as always unfolds from the infamous 221B Baker Street, where Sherlock Holmes involves his eager relative in a new case- A murder, stolen artifact, and the python. The first stage starts with finding the dead body and investigating about the stolen artifact and examining the museum. Sherlock and the player goes on hunting for clues, making deduction and moving forward with the game. In the second stage, they find out about the secret society through the secret workroom in the victim's house. The later stages involve action based confrontation and revealing the connections between the victim, the artifact and the python. \n",
